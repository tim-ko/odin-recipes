      <li>1 pinch ground white pepper</li>

      <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon hot water, or more as needed (Optional)</li>

      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Eggs Benedict</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>

      <li>8 eggs</li>

      <li>8 strips Canadian-style bacon</li>

      <li>4 English muffins, split</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the Hollandaise: Whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of
        water, Worcestershire sauce, and white pepper in the top of a double
        boiler over simmering water. Add melted butter, 1 or 2 tablespoons at a
        time, while whisking yolks constantly. If Hollandaise begins to get too
        thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water. Continue whisking until all
        of the butter is incorporated. Whisk in salt, then remove from heat.
        Place a lid on the pan to keep sauce warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        To poach the eggs: Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and
        bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar, and keep
        water at a gentle simmer. Crack an egg into a small bowl then gently
        slip egg into simmering water, holding the bowl just above the surface
        of water. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Cook eggs until whites are
        firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.
        Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to
        remove excess water, and place onto a warm plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and
        preheat the oven's broiler. Brown bacon in a medium skillet over
        medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toast English muffins on a baking sheet under the preheated broiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve eggs Benedict: Spread toasted muffins with softened butter and
        top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached egg. Place 2
        muffins on each plate and drizzle with Hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with
        chopped chives and serve immediately.
      </li>
