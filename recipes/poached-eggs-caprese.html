    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      These poached caprese eggs are a delicious dish inspired by eggs Benedict
      with mozzarella, tomatoes, and pesto.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>

      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

      <li>4 (1 ounce) slices mozzarella cheese</li>

      <li>1 tomato, thickly sliced</li>

      <li>2 English muffins, split</li>

      <li>4 large eggs</li>

      <li>4 teaspoons pesto</li>

      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches water and bring to a boil over
        high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar and 2 teaspoons
        salt, and keep water at a gentle simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        While waiting for water to simmer, place 1 mozzarella cheese slice and 1
        tomato slice onto each English muffin half. Cook in a toaster oven until
        cheese softens and English muffin has toasted, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crack an egg into a small bowl. Holding the bowl just above water's
        surface, gently slip egg into simmering water. Repeat with remaining
        eggs. Poach eggs until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are
        not hard, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon
        and dab them on a kitchen towel to remove excess water.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble, place a poached egg on top of each English muffin. Spoon 1
        teaspoon pesto sauce onto each egg and sprinkle with salt.
      </li>
    </ol>
